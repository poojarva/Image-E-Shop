# How to Use Image E-Shop

Using the Buy button, you can buy a certain image and continue to buy that item until the quantity runs out (in which the product will automatically be removed from the database)

Then you can access 'Sellers Dashboard' in order to see all of the sellers and the total profits they have made on x amount of products they have sold!
